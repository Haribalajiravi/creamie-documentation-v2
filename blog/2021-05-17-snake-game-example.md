Hi everyone,

Find this snake game as a good example. Snake's board is implemented based on [loop](https://creamie.io/docs/directives#how-to-display-list-of-data-to-dom) directive.

Features used in this example

- [loop directive](https://creamie.io/docs/directives) (snakes board as loop binder state)
- [if directive](https://creamie.io/docs/directives) (addition/removal of play button)
- [events](https://creamie.io/docs/events) (all click events)
- [binder](https://creamie.io/docs/binder) (showing game score as HTMLElement binder state)
